This is an effort to help people to get their groceries in this difficult time of COVID-19. This script helps you to find a delivery window of InstaCart (and Amazon `todo`) and alert (you will hear this [Beep sound](https://clyp.it/fjrsqftl) as alert) you when it is available. 
`This is a barebone (non-optimized) script - a quick hack.`

# How to use this finder
## Step 0
*a)* Install `npm` and `nodejs`
Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download any version of the binary, that will be used for installing `node` as well as `npm`. Then double click the downloaded binary and follow the instructions to install `npm` as well as `node` . To confirm the installation, open your terminal.app window and run `node -v` if that outputs a version number, then you are good to move forward.

*b)* Download (or clone) this repo by clicking green "Clone or Download" button shown above. If you have downloaded, then unzip the downloaded folder (`delivery-finder-master`) and rename the folder to `delivery-finder` 

## Step 1
Assuming you are on Mac OS, so open a terminal window and create a folder, let's say, `covid19` 
```
$ mkdir covid19
$ cd covid19
```
Move the downloaded folder `delivery-finder`  (as done in Step0-b above) in `covid19` folder

## Step 2
Go to instacart.com and login to your account. Take your time to add all your items in the shopping cart. Once you have all your desired items in the cart, then move to `Step 3`

## Step 3
Go to your cart page

## Step 4
On the checkout page, if there is no availability window, then you may see this page, then

## Step 5
Further

## Step 6
From the previous step you must have values of
1. `cookie`
2. `cache_key`
3. `address_id`

## Step 7
*IMPORTANT* - Make sure you don't close the instacart checkout page ever when this finder is running. So let the page remain opened.

## Step 8
Go to `covid19` folder and then further go to `delivery-finder` subfolder where all this codebase is residing. 

## Step 9
In the `delivery-finder` folder, you would find a file called `app.js`. Open that file in any editor and at the top of the file, you will find keys `instacart_cookie`, `cache_key` and `address_id` on lines 4,5 and 6 respectively.
Replace `XXXXX` with the values which you got in step 6. Then save the file.

## Step 10
Now in the terminal window at `/covid19/delivery-finder` folder , run `app.js`
```
$ node app.js
```

You may see the output
```
** SUCCESS ** YOUR CONFIGURATION VALUES ARE CORRECT, NOW LET THE FINDER FIND AND ALERT YOU. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THIS TERMINAL WINDOW OPEN WITH YOUR LAPTOP SOUND AT MAX
```

If you see any error, then it means you need to correctly put your values of keys 1. `cookie` 2. `cache_key` 3. `address_id`

That's all!!

## What to expect next.
Leave your computer plugged in and don't close it (let it remain connected to the internet). You may leave it in the low power mode if you wish. Let the terminal window remain opened and you may see a progress there every minute. This finder will keep checking the availability window every minute, you may hear a buzzing sound, when it finds an availability. Then you just go to the opened instacart checkout page (as mentioned in step 7) and refresh it. You may see the availability window.
